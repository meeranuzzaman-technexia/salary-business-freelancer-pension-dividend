/**
 * Business profit figures from the Business Books (16-Oct, user: "document se
 * bharne wala kaam kro").
 *
 * The 8 yearly totals of the Business profit step (Sales for the year ...
 * Tax already deducted on business receipts) are printed in the Business
 * Books, which every business filing uploads and maps. They are no longer
 * typed on the Business profit step:
 *   - Save & Approve Map on the Books copies them into the Business Profit
 *     selection (app/actions/extraction.ts);
 *   - every wizard save puts the mapped Books' figures back in place of
 *     whatever the browser sent (app/actions/filing.ts), so an old or stale
 *     typed figure can never replace them;
 *   - the Business profit step shows them read-only.
 * The Books' business name is only offered on the Business details entry
 * (filled in when the taxpayer starts that entry with the name empty); it is
 * never written here, because a half-filled Business details entry would stop
 * the packet, and the IRIS name may differ from the books.
 *
 * Pure functions only; the database read lives in
 * lib/tax/business-books-load.ts.
